Repertoire Assets FAQ
=====================

Q. My application produces the following error: "Controller class not found for controller `manifest'"

A. You have not installed the Rack middleware in your application's rackup file.  Consult the README.


Q. My HTML looks like the following, but the middleware is not expanding
javascript require statements.

index.html:
...
<script language='javascript'>
//- require <jquery>
//- require <widgets>
</script>
...

A. require and require instructions are only preprocessed in free-standing
javascript files. Instead, use:

index.html:
...
<script language='javascript' src='application.js'></script>
...

application.js:
...
//- require <jquery>
//- require <widgets>
...


Q. Can I use repertoire-assets together with merb-assets?

A. Yes.  It replaces merb-asset's bundling and javascript/stylesheet helpers,
but the remaining helpers can be used with assets from either the main app or
assets in gems.  (See below.)


Q. Why do gem assets appear mixed into the same url space?  Wouldn't it be
better to namespace them by the gem's name?

A. So that gems can specify in which directory in the host application they
appear.  e.g., 'foo_gem-0.0.1/public/images/foo/bar.png' is served as though it
were '<host app>/public/images/foo/bar.png'. 

This way, existing img_tag and other helpers in merb/rails can be used 
with assets pulled from gems.
