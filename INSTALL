Repertoire Assets
=================

(1) Make sure your application loads the middleware. e.g. for Merb:

    <app>/config/init.ru (Mongrel)
    <app>/config.ru      (Passenger) 
  
*    require 'repertoire-assets'
*    use Repertoire::Assets::Processor, Merb::Config, Merb.logger
    
    run Merb::Rack::Application.new

(2) Turn on precaching and compression in your production environment,
    so gem assets are served by your web server. e.g. for Merb:
  
    <app>/config/environments/production.rb:
  
*    c[:compress_assets] = true
